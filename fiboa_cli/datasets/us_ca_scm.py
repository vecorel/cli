DESCRIPTION = """
For many years, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has collected land use data throughout the state
and used this information to develop water use estimates for statewide and regional planning efforts, including water
use projections, water use efficiency evaluation, groundwater model development, and water transfers. These data are
essential for regional analysis and decision making, which has become increasingly important as DWR and other state agencies
seek to address resource management issues, regulatory compliance issues, environmental impacts, ecosystem services,
urban and economic development, and other issues.
